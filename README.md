🚗 Vehicle Fleet Performance Dashboard

An interactive web-based dashboard built with Python, Pandas, and Streamlit, designed to analyze and visualize vehicle fleet performance metrics.
Ideal for fleet managers, automotive analysts, and data enthusiasts who want to explore insights from real-world operational data.

This project showcases practical data analytics, interactive visualization, and efficient data filtering — all in one streamlined, modern dashboard.

🛠️ Features
🎯 Core Functionality

Dynamic Filters – instantly filter data by Brand, Vehicle Type, Driver, and Month.

Key Metrics (KPI Cards) – display real-time fleet stats:

Total vehicles

Total mileage

Total fuel used

Total trips

📊 Data Visualization

Vehicles by Type – histogram of fleet distribution.

Total Mileage by Brand – compare brand performance.

Monthly Trends – line chart of mileage and fuel usage over time.

Mileage vs. Fuel Usage – scatter plot for identifying efficiency outliers.

Average Fuel Efficiency per Driver – detect the most fuel-efficient drivers.

Maintenance Cost per Model – identify costly vehicles.

Trips per Route – visualize route activity levels.

Correlation Heatmap – explore relationships between mileage, fuel, maintenance, and trips.

💡 Analytical Enhancements

Automated Insights – dynamically generated key takeaways (e.g., top-performing brand, most fuel-efficient vehicle, average cost per km).

Cost Efficiency Metrics – calculate and display total operating cost per km, including estimated fuel costs.

🧭 User Experience

Tabbed Layout – cleanly organized sections:

Overview

Visualizations

Maintenance & Costs

Data Export

Data Export – download filtered data instantly as a CSV file.

Caching for Speed – optimized with @st.cache_data for faster loading.

Responsive Design – fully adaptive charts and layout for all devices.

📊 Technologies Used

Python 3.13+

Pandas – for data manipulation

Plotly – for rich, interactive data visualizations

Streamlit – for intuitive web app development

Open-source libraries: numpy, xlsxwriter, openpyxl
